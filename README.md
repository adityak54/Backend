basically it contains the best method file structure to factor our code.
It uses index.js, routes and controller
We are just sending a simple h1 here
index.js contains the main server
routes folder has authRoutes.js which has all middlewares (cors,router)
controller folder has authController.js which has the main callback function which sends a h1 saying Hello to server
