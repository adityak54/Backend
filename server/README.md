Functionality
The project is structured to handle basic server operations using Node.js and Express. When the server is running, it listens for requests and responds with a simple <h1> tag saying "Hello" to the client.
It contains the best file structure and practices (index.js, controller, routes) for backend

File Structure
    index.js: Contains the main server setup.
    routes/authRoutes.js: Contains all the route definitions and middleware configurations (e.g., CORS, router setup).
    controllers/authController.js: Contains the main callback functions for handling requests and sending responses.
